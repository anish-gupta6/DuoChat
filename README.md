# 💬 Duochat (Rebuilt from Scratch)

This is the **recovered and official version** of the Duochat project.

## ⚠️ What Happened

Duochat was initially hosted in a previous repository where a collaborator with write access made unauthorized and disruptive changes to the codebase. As a result:

- The original code structure and logic were compromised.
- I made the decision to **delete the old repository** and **republish Duochat** from the ground up.

## 🚀 About Duochat

Duochat is a real-time two-person chat application designed with simplicity and performance in mind. It features:

- One-on-one messaging
- Real-time updates
- Audio/Video call support

## 📌 Current Status

The project is now under active development with a focus on stability, quality, and security. Future plans and changes will be reflected.
